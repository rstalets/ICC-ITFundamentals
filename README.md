## Course Purpose
The purpose of this course is to introuduce the student to the field of information technology (IT) and prepare them to take the CompTIA IT Fundamentals+ certification. Students in this course should be individuals interested in pursuing a career in information technology. It is _not_ a course which is intended to provide instruction on how to use a computer, email, word processing programs, or the internet. Students who need instruction on how to use a computer or the internet are encouraged to contact the Workforce Development Office regarding Northstar Digital Literacy. 

This is a **non-credit, no-grade** course offered through the ICC Workforce Development Office.

Students who complete this course through active participation will be ready to pursue additional courses (such as CompTIA A+ and networking) to prepare them for an entry-level information technology job. This course on its own will not be considered sufficient to begin an entry-level job to most employers.

## What Questions Does this Course Answer?
This course will answer five questions at a fundamental level.

1. How does a user interact with a computer and its software? (Week 1)
2. What does software run on? (Week 2)
3. How is software written? (Week 2-4)
4. What does the operating system run on? (Week 4-5)
5. How do computers communicate with each other? (Week 6)
6. How do we do all of this securely? (Week 7)

## Student Expectations
Every course you will take has certain expectations, and this one is no exception. Below are the expectations you will be expected to adhere to throughout the course.

1. Behave as you would in the workplace. This means you should: 
    - Be on time and ready to learn.
    - Keep class materials such as your book, notes, license keys, important documents, and links organized.
    - Take notes on instructions (such as the location of the class webpage and how to use this schedule) or assignments (such as which labs you should complete on a certain day) so that they do not need to be repeated.
    - Use the resources available to you (such as ICC Career Services) to help you grow in your workplace skills.
2. Read the assigned material before coming to class. With the exception of Week 1, students are expected to have read the assigned units before arriving to class. 
3. Participate actively. You will only get out of this class what you put into it - participate actively by completing all assigned reading, labs, and participating in class.
